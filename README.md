# Backpropagation Algorithm for Solving AND, OR, and XOR Problems

## Overview
This project implements a neural network to solve the **XOR** and other similar problems 
using the **Backpropagation Algorithm**. 
The model supports flexible configurations with different configurations of layers
- count of layers
- sizes
- activation functions
- learning parameters
- other

The configuration file allows the user to set parameters such as:

- epochs
- learning rate
- momentum
- use the momentum
- activation function for layers 

### Key Features:
- **Multiple Layer Support**: The model can work with different configurations of layers according to the settings for a specific task.
- **Customizable Configuration**: The configuration can be adjusted before execution, using the configuration file.
- **XOR Problem Solving**: The trained model achieves 100% accuracy in solving the XOR problem, depending on set parameters.

## Conclusion:
This backpropagation neural network efficiently solves logical problems like AND, OR, XOR and other similar problems.
It offers optimal performance when configured correctly.
